        This plugin adds a tab that will show the status of each piece of the
        torrent.
        
        There are three states for each piece: 
        not downloaded, downloaded, or currently downloading.  
        These are indicated by color.
        
        You can easily set the priority of a piece or a set of pieces by selecting them,
        right-click and set the priority.
        
        You can select multiple pieces in a few ways.
         - Click the first piece you want to select.  Hold Shift and click the
           last piece you want to select.  All pieces in between will be
        	 selected.
         - Clicking and dragging over the pieces you want to select
         - Holding Ctrl will start selecting pieces without unselecting the
           ones you have already selected
        
        
        Underneath all the pieces is a checkbox that will allow you to always
        prioritize the first un-downloaded piece of the torrent. This lets you
        start watching a movie while it is still downloading. After completing
        the torrent you should continue to seed for a while, because this
        behaviour is actually not sociable and bad for the torrent
        protocol. Please use with care.
